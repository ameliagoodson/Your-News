## App located here

## Description

This web application uses six APIs to provide users with news articles available in a number of languages, and to provide weather information based on the user's geolocation or user search input. It also displays a 'trending news' section. 

The website is fully responsive and is attractive on both desktop and mobile phones, with the sidebars switching location to a central navigation pane under a certain screen size to aid for better navigation and user experience on smaller devices.

The 'Covid News' feature is a handy link to the latest COVID-19 information globally. If a user wishes to view more specific news on this subject, they can use the search bar.

   A number of free frontend newsAPIs were tested and this proved to be better than
   others. Available here:
